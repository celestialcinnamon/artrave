# artrave
A command-line utility to save a page for offline reading. 

## What it exactly is
artrave saves Web pages for offline reading. But unlike saving the page from your browser, artrave only saves the important parts of the page, sans ads, scripts, trackers, and stuff. It's like saving a page from Firefox's Reader Mode.

$ artrave 'https://celestialcinnamon.github.io/'
